The earlier version of this NS-2 add-on (for OFDM PHY) was developed at NIST. At the WiMAX Forum Plenary Meeting at Hawaii (January 30 - February 2, 2007), the decision to merge the independent development efforts supported by Application Architecture Task Group (AATG), WiMAX Forum and NIST was taken. In 2009 the source code was made available to public though the website http://community.4gdeveloper.com/ and is now hosted on Google code to gain a broader attention.

Credit is given to everybody who contributed to this software module, especially the development teams at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). Last but not least we would like to the Application Working Group (AWG) of the WIMAX Forum for there support.

This module is based on the network simulator ns-2 and implements the IEEE 802.16-2009 MAC layer based on WirelessMAN-OFDMA.
